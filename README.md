## 📖 Overview

**Reminda (Schedly)** is a dynamic, multi-sector mobile scheduling application designed for **college and high school students, healthcare workers (nurses & doctors), corporate shift employees (BPO, malls, fast food), and government personnel**.

People frequently miss classes, shift rotations, or duty handovers simply because managing scattered screenshots and rigid calendar apps is tedious. Reminda eliminates manual data entry by extracting schedule details directly from visual images and PDFs using **On-Device Neural OCR & Multimodal AI**, then instantly scheduling high-priority alarm reminders.

## ✨ Key Features

### 📷 1. Dual AI Schedule Scanner
- **100% On-Device Offline AI:** Powered by **Google ML Kit On-Device Neural Vision** paired with a custom **MMA (Multi-Modal Adaptive) Spatial Parser** to extract class codes, times, days, and rooms without requiring internet connectivity.
- **Multimodal Cloud AI Fallback:** Seamless cloud fallback powered by **Google Gemini Vision (`gemini-1.5-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash`)**, OpenRouter, and Cloudflare Workers AI for complex, noisy, or rotated document layouts.
- **Interactive Review & Verification:** Inspect, edit, add instructors/supervisors, adjust reminder leads, and fine-tune entries before saving.

### 🎓 2. Multi-Sector Timetable Profiles
- **School & University:** Track course codes, classroom/lab rooms, and professors across Philippine universities (UM, UIC, CJC, Ateneo, UP, UST, USEP, etc.).
- **Hospital & Clinic:** Organize ward assignments, doctor rotations, and hospital duty shifts.
- **Work & Corporate:** Manage rotating morning, mid, night, and graveyard shifts.
- **Custom / Government:** Adaptable for public sector duties, freelance routines, and personal projects.

### ⏰ 3. Smart Alarms & Crystal Chime Notifications
- **Custom Melodies:** High-quality built-in tones including *Crystal Chime*, *Zen Bell*, *Electronic Pulse*, and *Soft Marimba*.
- **Advance Reminder Alerts:** Flexible reminder lead times (5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h before).
- **Exact Background Alarm Dispatch:** Uses Android exact alarms and notification channels so alarms reliably ring even when the device is locked, on battery saver, or offline.

### ☁️ 4. Google Cloud Backup & Strict Account Sandboxing
- **Real-Time Firebase Firestore Sync:** Synchronizes profiles and timetables across devices when signed in with Google or Email.
- **100% Multi-Account Isolation:** Clean local cache purging on logout ensures zero cross-account data leaks between different Google accounts on the same device.
- **Guest Mode:** Complete offline usage without requiring registration or email.

### 💬 5. In-App Feedback & Anonymous Telemetry Pipeline
- **Direct Feedback System:** Integrated 5-star rating, category chips (*Bug Report, Feature Request, Scanner Issue, General*), and direct feedback delivery to Firestore.
- **Ground-Truth Dataset Telemetry:** Optional anonymous collection of layout formatting and verified corrections to continuously improve future offline AI models in compliance with the **Data Privacy Act of 2012 (RA 10173)**.

### 🛡️ 6. Full Data Ownership & Cascade Management
- **1-Tap Export:** Export complete timetables to Formatted Text, Excel CSV, or JSON backup.
- **Cascade Deletion:** Deleting a schedule profile permanently wipes out all associated schedule events, alarms, and cloud documents in real-time.
